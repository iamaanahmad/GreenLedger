Greener Lending

Project idea — EcoLoan Insights
A desktop-based web app that helps lenders score, verify, and trade loans based on environmental impact and sustainability credentials. It combines ESG scoring, automated green-tag verification, and portfolio analytics so banks can price, prioritize, and report green loans with confidence.

Core challenge to solve
Problem: Lenders struggle to verify and quantify the environmental impact of loans, which slows green lending, creates reporting risk, and prevents accurate pricing.
Goal: Provide a lightweight, auditable system that converts sustainability signals into actionable scores and tradeable tags, reducing verification time and increasing market liquidity for green loans.

Features to implement
Core (MVP)

Green Score Engine — compute a standardized ESG score per loan from mock inputs (project type, emissions estimate, certifications).

Verification Workflow — checklist + document upload placeholder; simulated third‑party verification stamp.

Green Tagging — attach immutable “GreenTag” to loans that pass verification (simulated ledger).

Green Marketplace Filter — marketplace view filtered by GreenTag and score.

ESG Analytics Dashboard — portfolio CO₂ estimate, % green loans, yield vs. green score chart.

Exportable Green Report — downloadable summary for regulators/investors (mock PDF view).

Advanced (optional polish)

API stub for carbon data (mocked) to auto-populate emissions.

Scenario simulator — show how refinancing or green upgrades improve score and yield.

Investor view — risk/return tradeoff visualization for green vs non-green loans.

Audit trail — immutable log of verification steps and score changes.

Why this is commercially viable
Regulatory tailwind: Banks need ESG reporting; this reduces manual effort.

Market differentiation: Enables premium pricing for verified green loans.

Liquidity: GreenTag makes loans discoverable to ESG-focused buyers.

Low barrier to demo: Scoring and verification can be convincingly simulated with mock data.

Lean tech stack suggestion
Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind (you already use these)

State / Mock backend: Local JSON or Firebase (mock verification status)

Charts: Recharts or Chart.js

Packaging: Vite for web; optional Electron wrapper for desktop feel

Extras: Use AI-assisted coding for scoring heuristics and report text
